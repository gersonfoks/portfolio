Concretely, we investigated the following research question: <i>What is the effect of light exposure on the development of preterm babies?</i> We found no clear relationship between the light exposure and the development of preterm babies, but it was not clear if this was due to data quality issues (such as the size and lack of good outcome variable) or because there isn&#39;t a relationship between light exposure and the development of a preterm baby. </p></section><section class="section"><h1 class="title is-4">Context</h1><p> Every year, approximately 15 million babies are born prematurely worldwide. Premature birth is associated with higher risks for developing health complications shortly after birth, including respiratory distress, hypoglycemia and jaundice. In addition, preterm birth may impact cognitive and motor development, potentially leading to developmental issues later in life, such as learning difficulties and behavioural problems. Preterm babies are often admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) following birth, where they receive specialised care during the first period of their lives. During their stay in the NICU, preterm babies are exposed to a variety of stimuli, including light. Little is known about the effect of light exposure on the development of preterm babies. There is however reason to believe that light exposure might influence the development of preterm babies. For example, it is know that light exposure is important for regulating different physiological processes in the body, such as the sleep-wake cycle and the production of melatonin. Furthermore, the mechanisms in which light influences these processes is well understood. </p></section><section class="section"><h1 class="title is-4">Data</h1><p> The data we have access to consists of 136 patients that were in the NICU and HCU at UMC Utrecht. The data consisted of heart rate, body temperature, light and sound exposure and saturation measurements as well as the weight and skull circumference of the babies. Lastly, the results from MRI scans at 40 weeks of a selected group of babies were available. We looked at the light exposure, skull size, the patient&#39;s weight and measures from the MRI scans such as brain volume. </p><h2 class="title is-5">Data preparation</h2><p> Several data quality issues where found when exploring the data. First of all, the babies got light therapy for their jaundice. Due to this there where high peaks in light measurements in the initial period of the babies stay in the NICU. It is unclear however if we should remove these measurements or not as the babies wear eye patches during the light therapy. Given that most effects of the light for regulated the internal processes thought to be mediated through the eyes. We decided to remove the light measurements during the light therapy from the dataset. The second biggest problem we encountered was that the sampling frequency of the different measurements was not the same. Some measurements were taken every 1 minute or so, while others were taken every 2 hours. This made it difficult to compare the different measurements. To solve this problem we resampled the data to a frequency of 2 measurements per hour. Note that all these changes influences the data and may influence the outcome of the analysis. </p><h2 class="title is-5">Feature extraction</h2><p> One challenge was to extract features from the data that could be used in the analysis. To make sure the photo therapy did not influence the results the features were extracted after the photo therapy was finished. We used the following features: <ul><li>Mean Light exposure</li><li>Variance of the light exposure</li><li>Auto-correlation of the light in time-steps of 2,4 and 8 hours to capture potential day/night cycles </li></ul> We also were planning to look into using fourier transformation to extract any rhythmicity in the data, but due to time constraints we did not get to this. </p></section><section class="section"><h1 class="title is-4">Analysis</h1> During the challenge we did several analysis, but nothing lead to significant results. As an example we can look at the correlation between the light exposure and the brain volume: <figure class="image"><img src="'+c+'" alt="Correlation between light exposure and brain volume"><figcaption class="is-size-7 has-text-centered"> Correlation between light exposure and brain volume. </figcaption></figure> There is a small correlation between the light exposure and the brain volume. However there is more correlation between the features themselves, which makes any further analysis difficult. Despite that we did several analysis, nothing leading to significant results. For example. We did a linear regression on the brain volume and the light exposure. <figure class="image"><img src="'+d+'" alt="OLS regression "><figcaption class="is-size-7 has-text-centered"> OLS regression on the brain volume and the light exposure. No significant results were found. </figcaption></figure> We did not find that any of the features significantly influenced the brain volume as indicated by the high p-values. Furthermore the F-statistic was also not significant, indicating that the model as a whole was not significant. </section><section class="section"><h1 class="title is-4">Conclusion</h1> During this challenge we set out to investigate the effect of light exposure on the development of preterm babies using data from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the UMC Utrecht. In our analysis we did not find any significant results. However, we did find that the data quality was not optimal and several choices that we made could influence the outcome of the analysis such as removing the light therapy from the data. Therefore, we cannot conclude that there is no effect of light exposure on the development of preterm babies. Overall, it was a very interesting challenge and I learned a about working with medical data and the unique challenges that this kind of data brings along with it. </section></div></div></div>',1);function f(m,p,g,b,w,v){const e=a("PageHeading");return s(),o(r,null,[n(e,{title:"Ai For Preterm Babies"}),u],64)}const k=i(l,[["render",f]]);export{k as default};
